Purpose:  This program uses different versions of the Sieve of Eratosthenes to identify prime numbers.
Each version will find and display primes less than 500.
Then each version will find the primes up to 5,000, 50,000 and 100,000
displaying the amount of time (seconds with 4 decimal places) it took to complete each version
and displaying the number of primes.

Version 1: Check every value using Sieve process and replace composite numbers with 0's

Version 2: Beginning with prime X, skip X values and replace value with 0's

Version 3: Start replacing values with 0 starting at first replacement instead of beginning of list

Version 4: Use a counter to keep track of the number of composites to calculate total # of primes

Version 5:  Skip values based on patterns to minimize the number of repeat value replacements
and stop checking for multiples of primes once reaching a certain point (square root of the list size)
