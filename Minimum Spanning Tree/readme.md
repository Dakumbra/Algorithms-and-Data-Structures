In this project we took in data from the Stanford Network Analysis
Platform (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ - file: ca-GrQc under
Collaboration networks). This data (used as a list of edges) was used
along with Kruskal's algorithm to generate Minimum Spanning Trees (MST's)
for the data set. IDs are reassigned to a range of 0 to 5241 before
running operations.
