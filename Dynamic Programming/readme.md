The purpose of writing this program was to gain a greater understanding
of the dynamic programming approach to algorithm development. In this
project the "Coin Change Problem" was solved using both a greedy algorithm
approach and a dynamic programming approach. The solutions were compared
to one another by examining how many fewer coins the dynamic programming
approach found compared to the greedy algorithm approach. The final output
is a percentage that expresses this ratio taken as an average from the
number of runs made using different total amounts and differnt coin
denominations.
