This program is a simplified version of a section of the concept of
genetic programming demonstrated by Larry Gritz. In this program
S-expressions are formed using parse trees. This is a simplified version
using random binary operators which contains only the Operations (+,-,*,/)
the Variables (X,Y,Z) and one random integer (0-10). The program creates
100 random parse trees and outputs them in prefix order.
